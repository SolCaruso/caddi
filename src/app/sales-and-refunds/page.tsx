              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                CaDDi AI reserves the right to change prices for products at any time, and to correct inadvertent pricing errors. If you were charged more than the posted price, please contact us about a refund of the overcharge.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Should we reduce the price on any product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, contact our customer service team within 14 days of the price change to request a refund or credit of the difference in price.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                CaDDi AI may refuse or cancel any order or limit order quantity. We may also require additional qualifying information prior to processing any order. Once we receive your online order, we'll provide you with an email order confirmation.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Your receipt of an order confirmation does not signify acceptance of your order or constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. CaDDi AI reserves the right to accept or decline your order at any time for any reason. If we cancel an order after payment, we will refund it.

                Please review our shipping information to learn about how and when you will receive the products you purchased. Since delivery of your order can be impacted by events beyond our control once it leaves our facilities, we cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Given the handcrafted nature of our products and potential supply constraints, we may have to limit the number available for purchase and reserve the right to change the number at any time, even after you place an order. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered, we will cancel the order and refund your purchase price.
